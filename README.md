## 💫 Introduction 

Welcome, I'm an Astronomer graduate from Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (Santiago), with a Diploma in Data Science and Engineering from Universidad de Chile. I'm fluent in Spanish and English, with some past experience in Japanese and Latin.

I have a very special interest in exoplanet characterization, astrobiology, data science, machine learning and AIs.
